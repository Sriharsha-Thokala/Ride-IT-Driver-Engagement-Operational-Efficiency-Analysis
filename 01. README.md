# 📊 RIDE IT — Driver Engagement & Operational Efficiency Analysis

## 🚀 Project Overview
**RIDE IT** is a ride-hailing platform focused on increasing the **number of completed rides per driver** without expanding driver supply.

This project analyzes:
- Driver engagement  
- Ride funnel efficiency  
- Day-level and regional behavior patterns  

The objective is to identify **where rides are lost in the funnel** and how **operational efficiency** can be improved through **data-driven decisions**.

The analysis combines **SQL-based data modeling** with **Power BI dashboards** to transform raw operational data into **clear business insights and actionable recommendations**.

---

## 📅 Analysis Scope
- **Time Period:** January 2020 – June 2020  
- **Regions:** Germany, Spain  
- **Data Sources:**  
  - `Rideit_drivers`  
  - `Rideit_drivers_activity`

*(Driver-level table — mostly static attributes)*

| Column Name | Description |
|------------|------------|
| Id_driver | Unique driver identifier (Primary Key) |
| Date_registration | Driver activation date |
| Driver_rating | Avg rating over last 100 rides (quality proxy) |
| Gold_level_count | Number of weeks driver reached “Gold” status |
| Receive_marketing | Marketing opt-in flag |
| Country_code | Operating country |
| Service_type | TAXI / PHV / BOTH |

---

### B. Rideit_drivers_activity  
*(Driver-day level behavioral data)*

| Column Name | Description |
|------------|------------|
| Id_driver | Driver identifier (Foreign Key) |
| Active_date | Date of activity |
| Offers | Ride requests received |
| Bookings | Requests accepted |
| Bookings_cancelled_by_passenger | Passenger cancellations |
| Bookings_cancelled_by_driver | Driver cancellations |
| Rides | Completed rides |

---

## 🧠 Key Business Insights

### 1️⃣ Marketing Opt-In Drivers Perform Significantly Better
Drivers who opted in to marketing communications consistently outperformed others.

- **Gold awards per driver:**  
  - Opt-in: **16.82**  
  - Non-opt-in: **10.75**
- **Average rides per day:**  
  - Opt-in: **3.44**  
  - Non-opt-in: **2.50**

**Insight:**  
Marketing opt-in is a strong proxy for **high-intent, high-value drivers**.  
Non-opt-in drivers represent **untapped growth potential**, not poor performance.

---

### 2️⃣ Major Efficiency Gap in Offer → Ride Conversion

**Daily averages per driver**
- Offers: **13.06**
- Bookings: **9.91**
- Completed rides: **3.21**

**Funnel metrics**
- Offers → Rides conversion: **24.59%**
- Bookings → Rides completion: **81.83%**

**Insight:**  
Execution is strong once a booking is made.  
The main leakage occurs **before booking** due to offer quality, matching accuracy, and ETA reliability.

---

### 3️⃣ Strong Day-of-Week Behavioral Patterns

**Driver Supply & Engagement**
- Highest availability: Weekdays  
- Lower engagement and higher cancellations: Weekends  
- Best conversion: Tue–Wed (~28%)  
- Worst conversion: Sat–Sun (~20%)

**Driver Behavior**
- Highest acceptance: Mon–Fri (31–34%)  
- Lowest acceptance: Sat–Sun (~25%)  
- Highest driver cancellations: Sunday (10.17%)

**Passenger Behavior**
- Highest passenger cancellations: Sunday (11.9%)  
- Lowest cancellations: Midweek (~9.7–10%)

**Insight:**  
Weekends show lower commitment from both drivers and passengers.

---

### 4️⃣ COVID-19 Shock Revealed Structural Strength

During March–April 2020:
- Sharp decline in active drivers, offers, and rides  

However:
- Ride completion rate improved  
- Driver cancellation rate decreased  

**Insight:**  
Exit of low-engagement drivers improved overall reliability, indicating **quality of supply > quantity of supply**.

---

### 5️⃣ Country-Level Differences Require Local Strategy

| Country | Key Characteristics |
|------|------------------|
| Germany | Large but rigid driver base, slower recovery, underutilized supply |
| Spain | Smaller but elastic supply, faster recovery, better demand adaptation |

**Insight:**  
A one-size-fits-all strategy does not work across markets.

---

## 🎯 Strategic Recommendations

### 1️⃣ Convert High-Potential Non-Marketing Drivers
**Low cost, high ROI**
- Communicate earnings uplift, gold benefits, priority access, and rewards  
- Improves engagement without onboarding new drivers

---

### 2️⃣ Improve Offer → Booking Conversion (Top Priority)
- Improve ETA accuracy  
- Smarter driver–passenger matching  
- Reduce low-quality offers  
- Acceptance-based incentives  

**Outcome:** Higher bookings with existing supply

---

### 3️⃣ Reduce Passenger Cancellations
- Real-time driver movement visibility  
- Clearer ETAs  
- Cancellation friction after grace period  

**Outcome:** Higher ride completion and driver trust

---

### 4️⃣ Control Driver Cancellations
- Soft warnings and penalties  
- Faster gold status for low-cancellation drivers  

**Outcome:** More reliable driver behavior, especially on weekends

---

### 5️⃣ Day-Specific Operating Strategy

| Day Group | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| Tue–Thu | Maximize volume and utilization |
| Mon & Fri | Balance growth and reliability |
| Sat–Sun | Control quality and cancellations |

---

### 🌍 Country-Specific Strategy
- **Germany:** Improve utilization and passenger reliability  
- **Spain:** Scale demand while protecting efficiency  

---
